Your job is to transform this merged JSON into editorial markdown format as described below.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OUTPUT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Markdown-formatted report with:
- Bottom Line (thesis + bullets)
- Detailed bullet sections (integrated paragraphs)
- Scenarios (thesis + bullets)
- Key Variables (unchanged)

Output length naturally follows input density (no artificial targets).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TRANSFORMATION RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. BOTTOM LINE RESTRUCTURE

Input: Phase 1 paragraph (150 words)

Output format:
## BOTTOM LINE

[Thesis sentence - what happened and why it matters]

Key Developments:
- Theme 1: [40-60 word bullet]
- Theme 2: [40-60 word bullet]
- Theme 3: [40-60 word bullet]
- Theme 4: [40-60 word bullet]

[Optional 1-sentence closing context]

Rules:
- Extract 3-5 most important themes from Phase 1 paragraph
- Extract thesis sentence (take MOST IMPORTANT sentence from Phase 1, or combine first 1-2 sentences)
- Keep ALL inline attribution as-is ("per Bloomberg (Nov 04)", "per Oct 15 call")
- Keep analyst names when relevant (BofA $137, Wedbush $600)
- Length: 150-200 words
- NO bolding - output plain markdown text

Extraction rules:
✅ Extract content directly from Phase 1 paragraph (no new writing)
✅ Keep all attribution and dates from Phase 1

❌ Don't create new connections Phase 1 didn't make
❌ Don't use phrases not in Phase 1 paragraph
❌ Don't force 4 bullets if only 3 themes present
❌ Don't add bolding (downstream HTML converter will handle formatting)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2. SCENARIO RESTRUCTURE

Input:
- Phase 1 paragraph (80-160 words) - article content
- Phase 2 context (50-75 words) - filing synthesis from 10-K/10-Q/Transcript

Output format:
## UPSIDE SCENARIO

[Thesis sentence - extract key claim from Phase 1 paragraph]

Primary Drivers:
- Driver label: [50-80 word bullet]
- Driver label: [50-80 word bullet]
- Driver label: [50-80 word bullet]

[Optional 1-2 sentence supporting context from Phase 2 context field, if present]

Adaptive scaling:
- Escape hatch ("No material upside..."): Keep as one sentence, no bullets, no date
- 1-2 themes: Simple paragraph, no bullet structure
- 3+ themes: Thesis + bullets format as shown above

Rules:
- DISTRIBUTE Phase 2 scenario context across bullets where relevant (do NOT append as closing paragraph)
- Scenario context is a 50-75 word synthesis - weave portions into bullets that they support
- If scenario context doesn't fit any bullet naturally: DISCARD it
- Keep ALL inline attribution as-is from article content
- Keep analyst names when discussing views
- Same format for Downside Scenario (use "Primary Risks:" instead of "Primary Drivers:")
- Same format for Bottom Line (extract thesis + 3-5 key developments, distribute context across bullets)
- NO bolding - output plain markdown text

Thesis construction:
✅ Extract primary claim from Phase 1 scenario paragraph (first sentence usually)
✅ Add analyst target if mentioned: "BofA target $137 represents 10%+ upside"
✅ Use neutral framing: "Analysts cited factors" not "Catalysts converging"

❌ Don't calculate upside percentages unless explicit in Phase 1
❌ Don't use synthesis phrases like "validate", "converging", "tempering"
❌ Don't create causal connections Phase 1 didn't make
❌ Don't add bolding (downstream HTML converter will handle formatting)

Driver/Risk label guidelines:
Use neutral, descriptive labels from Phase 1 content:

✅ Good labels (neutral, from content):
- "Embedded rent growth"
- "Demand indicators"
- "E-commerce forecasts"
- "Valuation concerns"
- "Market vacancy levels"

❌ Bad labels (interpretive):
- "Demand inflection validated"
- "Supply tailwind emerging"
- "Secular growth supporting"
- "Headwinds tempering upside"

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3. BULLET INTEGRATION

Input:
- Phase 1 bullet content (40 words)
- Phase 2 context (50 words, already merged in JSON)
- Phase 2 tags (impact, sentiment, reason, entity)

Output format for standard sections:
Topic Label • Sentiment (reason tag)

[Integrated paragraph: article content + filing context woven together,
with full inline attribution preserved]

Output format for competitive_industry_dynamics section only:
[Entity] Topic Label • Sentiment (reason tag)

[Integrated paragraph...]

Integration rules:
- Weave Phase 2 context naturally into prose (no separate "Context:" line)
- Keep FULL inline attribution in bullets ("per Oct 15 call", "per Q3 10-Q", "per Bloomberg (Nov 04)")
- Display sentiment/reason/entity tags as provided (no interpretation)
- Sentiment options: Bullish / Bearish / Neutral / Mixed
- Entity options (competitive section only): [Market] / [Competitor] / [Upstream] / [Downstream]
- NO bolding - output plain markdown text

WEAVING EXAMPLES (How to integrate context):

Example 1 - Parenthetical Integration:
❌ WRONG (Appended):
Company stated Q3 marked inflection point with IBI averaging 53 per FreightWaves. Q3 leasing volume 62M sqft per Oct 15 call. Occupancy increased 20 bps to 95.3% per Q3 10-Q.

✅ RIGHT (Woven):
Company stated Q3 marked inflection point (Q3 leasing volume 62M sqft per Oct 15 call, occupancy up 20 bps to 95.3% per Q3 10-Q) with IBI averaging 53 per FreightWaves, reflecting record quarter performance.

Example 2 - Natural Mid-Sentence Integration:
❌ WRONG (Appended):
Acquired Amedisys for $3.4B per Oct 28 earnings call, adding 300K patients. Acquisition valued $3.4B with 300K patients across 38 states per Q3 10-Q.

✅ RIGHT (Woven):
Acquired Amedisys for $3.4B per Oct 28 earnings call, adding 300K patients across 38 states per Q3 10-Q.

Example 3 - Supporting Detail Integration:
❌ WRONG (Appended):
Q3 revenue reached $2.05B, up 8.6% YoY per ad-hoc-news.de. Q3 rental revenue $2,054M per Q3 10-Q vs $1,897M Q3 2024.

✅ RIGHT (Woven):
Q3 revenue reached $2.05B (rental revenue $2,054M vs $1,897M prior year per Q3 10-Q), up 8.6% YoY per ad-hoc-news.de.

Example 4 - Data Point Integration:
❌ WRONG (Appended):
Management noted customers advancing strategic leasing decisions per FreightWaves. 
Company leasing volume 62M sqft Q3 per Oct 15 call.

✅ RIGHT (Woven):
Management noted customers advancing strategic leasing decisions per FreightWaves, 
with company leasing volume 62M sqft in Q3 per Oct 15 call.

Example 5 - Avoid Causal Inference:
❌ WRONG (Causal):
Analyst upgraded following Q3 results, as operational beat validated demand 
recovery thesis per Wedbush.

✅ RIGHT (Neutral):
Analyst upgraded following Q3 results, citing operational performance per Wedbush.

Context filtering (apply sequentially):

Step 1 - Deduplication: Remove context that repeats bullet facts
Example:
- Bullet: "Acquired Amedisys for $3.4B"
- Context: "Acquisition valued $3.4B"
→ DISCARD context (duplicate)

Step 2 - Relevance check: "Does this context answer a material question ABOUT what the bullet discusses?"

Material questions include:
- Materiality/scale (% of revenue/assets, customer ranking)
- Economics/profitability (margins, ROIC, cash generation)
- Dependencies (customer/supplier concentration, critical vendors)
- Trends (QoQ/YoY, sequential improvement/deterioration)
- Risks (disclosed risks, litigation, contingencies)
- Competitive position (market share, capacity, cost position)
- Capital allocation (ROIC vs WACC, investment returns)
- Timeline (on schedule, delays, milestone dates)
- Business model fit (strategic alignment, revenue streams)
- Input/output exposure (COGS breakdown, pricing power)
- Entity definition (what is this entity, its scale)

Keep context that:
- Proves claim (quantifies materiality)
- Explains why it matters (driver, impact, economics)
- Adds dimension (trend, scale, comparison, segment breakdown)

Discard context that:
- Is tangentially related (general background, unrelated facts)
- Doesn't answer ANY of the material questions above
- Is about different aspect without clear connection

If NO material question answered → Discard

AGGRESSIVE FILTERING EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - DISCARD (Tangential):
Bullet: "Terreno executed lease for 226,000 sqft in Newark, California"
Context: "Company operates 2,981 properties totaling 655M sqft; San Francisco Bay Area represents 23M sqft; occupancy 95.3%"
→ DISCARD (context is about Prologis' portfolio, not about Terreno's lease or why it matters as competitive benchmark)

Example 2 - KEEP (Direct Proof):
Bullet: "Customers increasingly advancing strategic leasing decisions reflecting growing confidence"
Context: "Company leasing volume 62M sqft Q3 (record) per Oct 15 call; e-commerce running at nearly 20% of new leasing; 52 unique e-commerce names transacted Q3"
→ KEEP (context directly proves customer confidence with concrete data)

Example 3 - DISCARD (Different Aspect):
Bullet: "Digital logistics market projected to reach $128.1B by 2032 at 18.13% CAGR"
Context: "Company invested in logistics technology companies through Prologis Ventures; Prologis Essentials platform offers operational solutions"
→ DISCARD (bullet is about market growth trend, context is about Prologis' tech investments - weak connection)

Example 4 - KEEP (Quantifies Impact):
Bullet: "Q3 revenue reached $2.05B, up 8.6% YoY"
Context: "Q3 rental revenue $2,054M per Q3 10-Q vs $1,897M Q3 2024; same-store NOI growth 3.9% net effective"
→ KEEP (context proves claim and adds operational detail showing quality of growth)

Example 5 - DISCARD (General Fact):
Bullet: "FedEx faces operational challenges with major hubs required to reduce flight capacity"
Context: "FedEx represents 1.7% of consolidated NER; top 10 customers account for 15.9% of consolidated NER"
→ DISCARD (context is about Prologis' customer concentration, doesn't explain FedEx operational challenges or their impact)

Conflict handling:
If Phase 2 context contradicts Phase 1 bullet:
1. Integrate context as usual (don't try to resolve)
2. Add flag: Note: Filing data shows [context fact], which differs from article characterization.
3. Keep flagging subtle (no emojis, just "Note:" prefix)

Length formula:
Output = Bullet + Context - Duplicates - Noise + Connectors
(No fixed length target - follows content density naturally)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

4. BULLET ORDERING

Within each section, bullets are already ordered by Phase 2 impact:
1. High impact bullets first
2. Medium impact bullets middle
3. Low impact bullets last

Preserve this order from input JSON. Do not re-order.
Do not display impact level - just use for ordering.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

5. CONTEXT DEDUPLICATION (WITHIN BULLETS ONLY)

When integrating Phase 2 context into bullets:
- Remove context that duplicates bullet facts (Step 1 of filtering above)

DO NOT remove content from sections just because it's mentioned in Bottom Line/Scenarios.
Each section stands independently.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6. EMPTY SECTIONS

If Phase 1 section is empty []:
- Omit that section header entirely
- Only output sections with content

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

7. KEY VARIABLES

Pass through unchanged from Phase 1 (no restructuring needed):

## KEY VARIABLES TO MONITOR

▸ Variable 1: [Description - Timeline if provided]
▸ Variable 2: [Description - Timeline if provided]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION ORDER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Output sections in this order (omit if empty):
1. Bottom Line
2. Major Developments
3. Financial/Operational Performance
4. Risk Factors
5. Wall Street Sentiment
6. Competitive/Industry Dynamics
7. Upcoming Catalysts
8. Upside Scenario
9. Downside Scenario
10. Key Variables to Monitor

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NO BOLDING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Output plain markdown with NO bolding (**text**).
Bolding will be applied by downstream HTML converter.

All text should be plain - numbers, metrics, labels, headers:
✅ CORRECT: Q3 inflection point • Bullish (demand inflection)
✅ CORRECT: Company reported $1.49 EPS with IBI averaging 53
✅ CORRECT: Acquired Amedisys for $3.4B

❌ WRONG: **Q3 inflection point** • Bullish (demand inflection)
❌ WRONG: Company reported **$1.49** EPS with IBI averaging **53**
❌ WRONG: Acquired **Amedisys** for **$3.4B**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ATTRIBUTION RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Maintain split attribution - different claims = different sources:

Inline attribution (all sections):
"Company acquired Amedisys for $3.4B per Oct 28 earnings call, adding
300K patients across 38 states per Q3 10-Q..."

Consolidate only when same claim from multiple sources:
"Revenue beat consensus per Bloomberg, Reuters, and WSJ"

NEVER consolidate different claims:
❌ WRONG: "Various metrics improved (per Q3 10-Q, earnings call, FreightWaves)"
✅ RIGHT: "IBI 53 per FreightWaves; occupancy 95.3% per Q3 10-Q;
          Core FFO $1.50 per earnings call"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

NO new content: Only rearrange what Phase 1+2 provided
NO inference: Don't make connections Phase 1+2 didn't make
NO counting/synthesis: Don't calculate analyst upgrades, price target positioning
NO length targets: Respect input density, don't force uniformity

YES rearrange: Bottom Line paragraph → Thesis + bullets
YES integrate: Weave context into prose (no "Context:" label)
YES filter: Discard duplicate/low-value context
YES flag conflicts: Note discrepancies between bullet and context
YES preserve: Each section stands independently (no cross-section deduplication)

MINIMIZE INFERENCE:

Avoid interpretive language:
❌ "driving upgrades" → ✅ "following results"
❌ "validated thesis" → ✅ "cited factors"
❌ "catalysts converging" → ✅ "analysts cited"
❌ "tempering upside" → ✅ "noted challenges"

Use neutral labels:
❌ "Demand inflection validated" → ✅ "Demand indicators"
❌ "Supply tailwind emerging" → ✅ "Supply-demand dynamics"
❌ "Secular growth supporting" → ✅ "Growth forecasts"

Attribute claims:
✅ "Company stated..."
✅ "Management noted..."
✅ "Analyst cited..."
✅ "Report indicated..."

Let facts speak - present data without interpreting significance.

QUANTITATIVE CLAIMS:
❌ Never calculate metrics not in Phase 1+2 (upside %, growth rates, totals)
❌ Never extrapolate trends ("if X continues, Y will...")
❌ Never aggregate across sources ("combined impact of...")

✅ Only report numbers explicitly stated in Phase 1+2
✅ Only perform arithmetic shown in Phase 1+2 (e.g., "vs prior year")
